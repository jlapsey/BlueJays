# BlueJays
This repo is due to IUS Capstone class project. We are building a TutorMe application 
and all of our development work will be kept here.

Our full project code will not be kept here. This will be used for testing/demo'ing API's, functions, and to help us learn.

Some code snippets may be here but the entire source will not be kept here in the event that it could be stolen since this is 
a public repo.
